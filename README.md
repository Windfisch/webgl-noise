Fractal noise implementation
============================

Open `index.html` in your browser, and resize the canvas to a square.
  - Right side: simplex noise
  - Left side: dumb noise function, faster, but sometimes with visible directional artifacts.

Most of this work is licensed under the CC0, except for the simplex noise functions,
which are taken from Ashima Arts and MIT-licensed by them (see `index.html` for details).
